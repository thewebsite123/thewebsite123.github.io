<p><b>The History of The Website</b></p>

<p>By Eviper</p>

<p>Well it looks like that we have dived into our new role as a content website so it sounds like a good idea to create a brief history so lets get started: oh and sorry about the wait</p>

<p><b>Part 1: Conception</b></p>

<p>Well I guess that the whole thing start with me learning basic JavaScript I made a few little tools for the website but as anything I make turns out they were crap. But I did learn an important lesson “Good things take time, A lot more time then I have” but I solider on and soon we had a small number of pages.</p>

<p><b>Part 2: Birth</b></p>

<p>Well this is where it gets a bit stranger. During an art class I got a bit bored and used student workspace to host a kind of weirder little child’s version of website. But we went on and added a ton of stuff that was hastily thrown together like a few image gallery’s and the whole team joined the website. Google analytics was added and the website was functioning off of a webhost it was a real website.</p>

<p><b>Part 3:</b> <b>Rebirth</b></p>

<p>After this we left the website alone for a long while. But we came back we made some huge changes adding the scroll back widget our first chat widget. We added a css theme and organised the website. It was when the website finally took off. Soon we were booming.</p>

<p><b>Part 4: Present Day</b></p>

<p>After I long time of slow up dates the website finally reached it’s current incarnation we have the shoutout box the about and the articles It is truly beautiful.</p>
